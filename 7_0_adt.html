<h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4" id="main-heading">Exploring Sand and Science</h1>
<p class="mb-2" data-id="text-7-0">How did that sand get there?</p>
<p class="mb-2" data-id="text-7-1">Where did it come from?</p>
<p class="mb-2" data-id="text-7-2">Did the sand come from the rock or does the rock come from sand?</p>
<p class="mb-2" data-id="text-7-3">And how would you know?</p>
<p class="mb-4" data-id="text-7-4">How do you tell this story?</p>
<p class="mb-2 font-semibold" data-id="text-7-5">Look. There's a puddle.</p>
<p class="mb-2" data-id="text-7-7">How often is there a puddle in the desert?</p>
<p class="mb-2" data-id="text-7-8">The sand is wet and fine;</p>
<p class="mb-2" data-id="text-7-9">and it makes swirling, layered patterns on the solid stone.</p>
<p class="mb-4" data-id="text-7-10">There are pits and pockets in the rock, like the one that these two scientists are sitting in, and the gritty sand and the cold water accumulate there.</p>
<p class="mb-2" data-id="text-7-12">And then you might start to wonder: Does the sand fill in the hole to form more rock, or is the hole worn away because it became sand?</p>
<p class="mb-4" data-id="text-7-15">And then you might wonder more about the giant formation in the background:</p>
<p class="mb-2" data-id="text-7-16">It has the same colors as the sand, so has this been built up or is it being worn down?</p>
<p class="mb-2" data-id="text-7-18">And if it's being built up by sand, how does it all get put together; and if it's being worn away then why does it make the patterns that we see in the rock?</p>
<p class="mb-2" data-id="text-7-21">Why? How long? What next?</p>
