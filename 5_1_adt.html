<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6" id="sec-title-text-only">What does science look and feel like?</h2>
<p class="mb-4" data-id="text-5-7">Often when we ask people to imagine this, they draw or describe people
                with lab coats, people with crazy hair, beakers and flasks of weird looking liquids that are bubbling and
                frothing.</p>
<p class="mb-4" data-id="text-5-8">Maybe there’s even an explosion.</p>
<p class="mb-4" data-id="text-5-9">Let’s be honest: Some scientists do look like this, or they look like
                other stereotypes: people readied with their pocket protectors and calculators, figuring out how to
                launch a rocket into orbit.</p>
<p class="mb-4" data-id="text-5-10">Or maybe what comes to mind is a list of steps that you might have to
                check off for your science fair project to be judged; or, maybe a graph or data table with lots of
                numbers comes to mind.</p>
