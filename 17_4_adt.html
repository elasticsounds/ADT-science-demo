                Analyze and interpret data to describe patterns of Earth’s features. Emphasize most earthquakes and
                volcanoes occur in bands that are often along the boundaries between continents and oceans while major
                mountain chains may be found inside continents or near their edges. Examples of data could include maps
                showing locations of mountains on continents and the ocean floor or the locations of volcanoes and
                earthquakes. (ESS2.B)

<p class="mb-4">In this chapter, you will be looking at different patterns we see in Earth’s Features.</p>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Volcanoes, Earthquakes, and Ocean Floor</h2>
<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Volcanoes</h3>
<p class="mb-4">Volcanoes are openings in the Earth’s crust that allow hot, melted rock (magma), ash, and
                gases to erupt outward. Volcanoes change the Earth’s surface in a short period of time. More than half
                of Earth’s surface is made up of volcanic rock. Volcanoes are evidence that we live on an active,
                changing planet.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Do you know how a volcano forms? Far below Earth’s surface, temperatures are hot enough to
                melt rock. The melted rock comes out of cracks in the Earth’s crust, resulting in a volcano. Some
                eruptions pour out rivers of lava while other volcanoes have larger eruptions. Volcanoes can erupt
                underwater, forming huge ranges of volcanic mountains on the ocean floor.</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Pacific Ring of Fire</h3>
<p class="mb-4">Most earthquakes and volcanic eruptions take place along the edges of the Pacific Ocean.
                The Earth’s crust is broken up into a series of massive sections called plates. The movements of these
                plates can account for noticeable changes to the Earth, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and the
                building of mountains.</p>
