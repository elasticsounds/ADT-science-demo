<p class="mb-4" data-id="text-27-0">Air (as water vapor), rivers and lakes, icecaps and glaciers, the ground (as soil moisture and in aquifers).</p>
<p class="mb-4">Even though you may only notice water on the Earth's surface, more freshwater is stored in the ground than there is in liquid form on the surface. In fact, some of the water you see flowing in rivers comes from water seeping into Earth's surface to become groundwater. Water from precipitation continually seeps into the ground to fill aquifers (underground reservoirs), while at the same time water in the ground continually fills rivers through seepage.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Humans make use of both surface water and groundwater. In the United States in 2010, we used about 275 billion gallons (1,041 billion liters) of surface water per day and about 79.3 billion gallons (300.2 billion liters) of groundwater per day. Although surface water is used more often to supply drinking water and to irrigate crops, groundwater is vital because it fills rivers and lakes and provides water for people in places where water is scarce, such as in desert towns of the western United States.</p>
