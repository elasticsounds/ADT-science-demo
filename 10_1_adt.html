<p class="mb-4" data-id="text-10-10">In the Science with Engineering Education (SEEd) Standards, specific
                engineering standards generally involve two types of tasks:</p>
<ol class="list-decimal list-inside mb-4">
<li class="mb-2" data-id="text-10-11">If the standard includes the idea of designing, then the design
                    process will contain components of defining the problem (along with identifying the criteria and
                    constraints), developing many possible solutions, and optimizing a solution (e.g., determining a best
                    solution for the situation based on the criteria and constraints, testing the solution, refining the
                    solution).</li>
<li data-id="text-10-12">If the standard includes the idea of evaluating, then the design process will
                    contain components of defining the problem (along with identifying the criteria and constraints) and
                    optimizing a solution.</li>
</ol>
<p class="mb-2" data-id="text-10-13">The idea of developing many possible solutions is not included because
                various solutions will be provided.</p>
<p data-id="text-10-14">The idea of evaluating then means determining a best solution from the provided
                solutions for the situation based on meeting the criteria and constraints requirements.</p>
